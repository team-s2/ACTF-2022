Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2
We introduce the key reinstallation attack. This attack abuses design
or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an
already-in-use key. This resets the key's associated parameters such
as transmit nonces and receive replay counters. Several types of
cryptographic Wi-Fi handshakes are affected by the attack.
All protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake to generate a fresh session key. So far, this 14-year-old handshake has
remained free from attacks, and is even proven secure. However,
we show that the 4-way handshake is vulnerable to a key reinstallation attack. Here, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an
already-in-use key. This is achieved by manipulating and replaying
handshake messages. When reinstalling the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (nonce) and
receive packet number (replay counter) are reset to their initial
value. Our key reinstallation attack also breaks the PeerKey, group
ACTF{Reinstallation-in-WPA2-,:)}
key, and Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake. The impact depends
on the handshake being attacked, and the data-confidentiality protocol in use. Simplified, against AES-CCMP an adversary can replay
and decrypt (but not forge) packets. This makes it possible to hijack
TCP streams and inject malicious data into them. Against WPATKIP and GCMP the impact is catastrophic: packets can be replayed,
decrypted, and forged. Because GCMP uses the same authentication
key in both communication directions, it is especially affected.
Finally, we confirmed our findings in practice, and found that
every Wi-Fi device is vulnerable to some variant of our attacks.
